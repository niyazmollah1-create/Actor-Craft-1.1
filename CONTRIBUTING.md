2. Create a new discussion with:
   - Clear description of the feature
   - Use cases and benefits
   - Implementation suggestions (if any)

### Code Contributions

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic

## üéØ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

```python
async def example_command(interaction: discord.Interaction, user: discord.Member) -> None:
    """
    Example command that demonstrates proper style.
    
    Args:
        interaction: The Discord interaction object
        user: The target user
    """
    # Your code here
```

### Cog Organization

- Place related commands in the same cog
- Use descriptive cog names and docstrings
- Keep cogs focused on a single responsibility

```python
class ExampleCog(commands.Cog):
    """Cog for example commands and functionality"""
    
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
```

### Error Handling

- Always handle potential errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors for debugging purposes

```python
try:
    # Your code here
    await interaction.response.send_message("Success!")
except discord.Forbidden:
    await interaction.response.send_message("I don't have permission to do that.", ephemeral=True)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in command: {e}")
    await interaction.response.send_message("An error occurred.", ephemeral=True)
```

### Command Design

- Use slash commands for all new commands
- Include helpful descriptions and parameter hints
- Set appropriate permissions
- Use embeds for rich responses

```python
@app_commands.command(name="example", description="An example command")
@app_commands.describe(user="The user to target")
async def example(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, user: discord.Member):
    embed = discord.Embed(title="Example", color=discord.Color.blue())
    await interaction.response.send_message(embed=embed)
```
